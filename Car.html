        </div>

    <h5 class="top">I wanted to make a pick-up truck as Mater is my favourite character from the movie ‘Cars’, but I
        thought he needed a bit of an update for this modern era. The car needs the ability to take cargo,
        but should be aerodynamic and sleek looking so that Mater can feel cool as Lightening McQueen.
        Also, I wanted a windscreen panel that went over the entire roof to make the car look very futuristic
        and smooth in air flow. This would mean that Mater wouldn’t need another update for a long time.
        I also didn’t want to make the design overly futuristic or complex as I don’t think that would fit
        Mater’s personality.<br><br>
        I decided to create three different models so that I could explore the effects of two different types
        of cover over the pickup zone on the drag and flow. Design one had no cover, design 2 had a simple
        cover, and design 3 had an aerodynamic cover.<br><br>
        I initially performed 2D pressure and velocity analysis on the different designs, and of note were the
        different flow detachments formed. I also looked at the flow trajectories of all 3 designs. When
        looking at the goal results it was apparent that the second design was optimal for Mater to use as
        it has the smallest value of drag, down force and the lowest drag coefficient. Calculations were
        then performed on this design, determining the coefficient of drag in two different ways, and
        determining the drag force and hence power required for the car.</h5>
    <h3 class="project_subheading">DRAWINGS</h3>
    <h5>In the initial drawings, I wanted to ensure the pickup zone was encorporated, but also create a sleek
        design for the car - hence why I have chosen to have a front glass pannel exteending all the way
        over the roof, along with a very simple and minimalistic design.
    </h5>

    <h3 class="project_subheading">CAD MODEL</h3>
    <h5>Based on my initial drawings, I modelled my car in Fusion 360, and created renders in a sleek black colour to
        look
        futuristic and stylish to fit Mater’s personality. I decided to create three different models so that I could
        explore the
        effects of two different types of cover over the pickup zone on the drag and flow.
    </h5>
    <img class="project" src="images/Car/image_2.png">
    <h3 class="project_subheading">VELOCTIY ANALYSIS</h3>
    <h5>Mater will have to drive at fast speeds on the motor way frequently and so I performed 2D pressure and velocity
        analyses to determine if my design was fit for Mater to use. It is interesting to see that with the three
        different designs
        there is a very different rear vacuum.
    </h5>
    <img class="project" src="images/Car/image_3.png">
    <h3 class="project_subheading">PRESSURE ANALYSIS</h3>
    <h5>I want Mater’s new design to last him for many years, so I performed a surface pressure analysis to ensure that
        the
        design was robust and would perform well.
    </h5>
    <img class="project" src="images/Car/image_4.png">
    <h3 class="project_subheading">FLOW TRAJECTORIES</h3>
    <h5>Mater will want to be fuel efficient, so to look at the air flow around the vehicle I analysed the flow
        trajectories to
        explore how the different shapes of the trunks’ would divert air differently - creating different vortexes.
    </h5>
    <img class="project" src="images/Car/image_5.png">
    <h3 class="project_subheading">GOAL RESULTS</h3>
    <h5>From the goal results it is apparent that design 2 is the best for Mater, as it has the smallest vallue of down
        force, the
        smallest value of drag, and the smallest value of the drag coefficient.
