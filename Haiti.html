    <h5 class="top">In this report, I investigated the energy requirements for Haiti in 10 years time, and suggested a
        proposal for how they might meet this demand. I chose Haiti, as when researching countries’
        energy consumption I found it fascinating that over 60% of their electricity is lost in transmission
        due to the poor infrastructure, and furthermore only 39% of the population currently has access to
        electricity.<br><br>
        I started by investigating the current energy consumption – which in 2018 was 40.7 TWh, and the
        total CO2 emissions were 3.2 Mt of CO2. I learnt that the largest share of energy, 76%, is used for
        residential purposes. To further my understanding of Haiti’s energy consumption, I looked into the
        production of energy. Although Haiti has enormous potential for renewable sources of energy
        generation, 81% of their energy is generated from oil. Furthermore the current capacity for
        electricity is insufficient as of those that have access, on average one person only receives 5-9
        hours of electricity per day. Furthermore emphasising how dire the situation is, Haiti is the 88th
        most populated country in the world and yet they are 184th in total electricity consumption.<br><br>
        By 2030, the entire nation is expected to be connected to electricity, and the population is expected
        to grow from 11.1 million to 12.7 million. For this reason I focused my proposal on how to supply
        sufficient electricity for this enormous deficit. My proposal generates 90% of the energy from
        renewable sources, utilising Haiti’s potential for solar and wind energy. 2000 GWh of solar
        electricity is generated by 5.22 km2 of solar panels, and 3600 GWh of wind energy is produced by
        515 wind turbines taking up 67.8 km2. Only existing petroleum power plants are used, and one
        small gas power plant must be built to supply 500 GWh when renewable are unable to.</h5>
    <h3 class="project_subheading">Current Energy Consumption, Production, and Supply</h3>
    <h5>Haiti has significant renewable energy resources. Strong solar irradiance throughout the country, numerous
        areas with significant wind resource potential, as well as underutilized opportunities for small hydropower
        and biomass all contribute to Haiti’s significant renewable energy prospects. So far, however, very little of
        this potential has been developed - besides two hydro power plants.6
    </h5>

    <h3 class="project_subheading">Energy requirement in 10 years time</h3>
    <h5>It is assumed that Haiti will experience significant economic growth and will achieve universal electricity
        access by 2030. Using population growth estimates, we assume that by 2030, Haiti’s average per capita
        electricity consumption will more closely resemble that of five neighboring countries: the Dominican
        Republic, El Salvador, Honduras, Jamaica, and Nicaragua. Projections assume an annual growth in
        electricity demand of 9% from 2012 to 2020, and of 13.4% from 2021 to 2030, to reach a total of 6,500 GWh
        by 2030. Based on this annual demand, peak demand is estimated to exceed 1 GW by 2030, indicating that
        Haiti will need to add significant new capacity in order to secure demand at peak times of the day over the
        next 20 years.6
    </h5>
    <img class="project" src="images/Haiti/image_2.png">
    <h3 class="project_subheading">Proposal</h3>
    <h5>This proposal looks mainly at how to accomodate Haiti’s massivly increased demand for electricity as more
        of the population become connected to the grid and the population grows. Furthermore this proposal is
        predominantly powered by renewables, creating a sustainable future. <br><br> In this future scenario, Haiti will
        be able to provide constant electricity to the entire population, and the vast
        majority of the energy being created will be renewable. Haiti is an ideal candidate for renewable energy as
        it has strong winds and intense sunlight. Only one fossil fuel plant is being created in order to fill the gap
        left by the unpredictability of renewable power generation. The space required for the suggested
        infrastructure is relatively small, especially given that Haiti is largely baren.
