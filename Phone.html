            <h3 class="project_title">Embodied Energy of a Phone</h3>
        </div>
    </div>
    <h5 class="top">In this report, I investigated the energy
        associated with each phase of the Samsung
        Galaxy S6’s lifetime. Initially I looked at the
        breakdown of materials in the phone. Each of
        these materials and their respective weights
        were put into CES EduPack to find their
        embodied energies. From this the total
        embodied energy of the phone was calculated
        to be 71 MJ. The embodied energy calculations
        for each material were also performed manually
        to verify the output from CES EduPack.<br><br>
        The phone is manufactured in Vietnam, then
        shipped to the UK, where it is driven to the store. The energy in transport was
        calculated in CES EduPack to be 1.26 MJ, however when calculated manually the value
        was 0.453 MJ. This difference is likely due to inefficiencies such as the ship taking a
        longer route, or not being loaded to 100% capacity.<br><br>
        The energy in use was then calculated for the phone – assuming the phone has a
        lifetime of only three years. This is based on the fact that Samsung stop supporting
        updates for phones over three years old. In one day, it was calculated that the energy
        use in standby mode would be 55,674 J, the energy in normal use would be 6,854 J,
        and the energy in heavy use would be 27,785 J – with the total for one day being
        approximately 90,313 J. The total energy use over the lifetime of the phone would be
        98.9 MJ.</h5>
    <h3 class="project_subheading">Breakdown of materials used</h3>
    <h5>For the teardown of the Samsung Galaxy S6 phone,
        preliminary data on the materials used was gleaned
        from Figure 1. From this, the major material groups
        were determined, then further refined with specific
        information for the S6, such as the type of Aluminium
        used. The masses were approximated from Figure 1,
        and using the CES EduPack database [4], embodied
        energies were calculated for each material, with a
        total embodied energy of 71MJ for the phone. Table 1
        shows the materials, their respective masses and
        embodied energies. Some assumptions and estimates were made where data was
        unavailable, such as the ‘others’ section was presumed to be the camera module. The results
        from CES EduPack can be seen in Figure 2.

    <h3 class="project_subheading">Material Assumptions</h3>
    <h5><b>1. Cardboard [3]</b><br>
        The phone is packaged in a box, which was determined to be made from cardboard.
        Cardboard is used for its lightweight, manufacturable and fairly durable qualities.
        Cardboard also allows for images and product descriptions to be printed upon it.
        <br><br><b>2. Polycarbonate (PC)</b><br>
        The back of the phone is made from polycarbonate, this is a material that is easily
        moulded to make a phone shape and can be coloured for personalisation. In addition,
        polycarbonate has good strength, toughness and durability properties, which are suitable
        qualities for providing the phone with protection against scratches and drops.
        <br><br><b>3. Paper</b><br>
        Paper is used for the instructions manual of the phone, which is included within the
        packaging when a new phone is bought. Paper is used as a common material in which
        usage and care instructions can be printed upon in bulk.
        <br><br><b>4. Aluminium 6013 [1]</b><br>
        Aluminium’s good strength, toughness and durability properties allows for a strong and
        stable phone frame, which safely holds all the inner components of the phone. The
        specific alloy used in the S6 is 6013.
        <br><br><b>5. Lithium Ion Battery [2]</b><br>
        Lithium-ion batteries are one of the lightest batteries with a good energy density – making
        it suitable for smart phone use. In CES EduPack, the option for a rechargeable lithium-ion
        battery was selected.
        <br><br><b>6. LCD Module</b><br>
        In CES EduPack, the option for a liquid crystal display panel was selected.
        Figure 1 - Breakdown of phone [5]
        <br><br><b>7. Printed Circuit Board</b><br>
        In CES EduPack, the option for a printed circuit board assembly was chosen.
        <br><br><b>8. Camera Module</b><br>
        The main other component of the smart phone was the rear camera, which was assumed
        to be made of soda lime glass, for its optical transparency qualities, and resistance to
        scratches, unlike other transparent materials such as acrylic or Perspex.

    <h3 class="project_subheading">Material embodied energy calculations</h3>
    <h5>Using data from the CES EduPack database [4], the embodied energies for each component of
        the phone was calculated. This was achieved by multiplying the component’s mass by the
        material’s embodied energy per kilogram. Calculations can be seen below:<br><br>
        <b>• Cardboard</b>, mass = 0.13kg<br>
        Material embodied energy = 49-54 MJ/kg, mean = 51.5 MJ/kg
        Component embodied energy = 0.13 x 51.5 = 6.70 MJ
        <br><br> <b>• Polycarbonate (PC)</b>, mass = 0.064 kg<br>
        Material embodied energy = 100-111 MJ/kg, mean = 105.5 MJ/kg
        Component embodied energy = 0.064 x 105.5 = 6.75MJ
        <br><br> <b>• Paper</b>, mass = 0.052 kg=<br>
        Material embodied energy = 49-54 MJ/kg, mean = 51.5 MJ/kg
        Component embodied energy = 0.052 x 51.5 = 2.68 MJ
        <br><br> <b> • 6013 Aluminium</b>, mass = 0.048 kg<br>
        Material embodied energy = 186-205 MJ/kg, mean = 195.5 MJ/kg
        Component embodied energy = 0.048 x 195.5 = 9.38 MJ
        <br><br> <b>• Lithium Ion Battery</b>, mass = 0.04 kg<br>
        Material embodied energy = 900 MJ/kg
        Component embodied energy = 0.04 x 900 = 36 MJ
        <br><br> <b>• LCD Module</b>, mass = 0.024 kg<br>
        Material embodied energy = 240 MJ/kg
        Component embodied energy = 0.024 x 240 = 5.76 MJ
        <br><br> <b>• Printed Circuit Board</b>, mass = 0.024 kg<br>
        Material embodied energy = 130 MJ/kg
        Component embodied energy = 0.024 x 130 = 3.12 MJ
        <br><br> <b>• Camera Module</b>, mass = 0.02 kg<br>
        Material embodied energy = 10.1-11.1 MJ/kg, mean = 10.6 MJ/kg
        Component embodied energy = 0.02 x 10.6 = 0.21 MJ
        <br><br>Total Embodied Energy = 70.6 MJ
    </h5>
    <h3 class="project_subheading">Transport embodied energy calculations</h3>
    <h5>CES EduPack was also used to calculate the energy used in transporting the phone from the
        Samsung manufacturing plant in Vietnam to London. This was assumed to be 17,000 km by a
        shipping container to Southampton port, then 100 km by lorry to London. The CES value was
        1.26 MJ, but independent calculations were performed below to verify this number.
        If an ocean freight ship containing 18,000 shipping containers was to travel 21,140 km from
        Hong Kong to Hamburg, the fuel required would contain approximately 195,300 GJ of energy
        [6].<br><br>
        Energy per km = 195,300 ÷ 21,140 = 9.24 GJ/km<br><br>
        The phone will travel 17,000 km from Saigon, Vietnam to Southampton, UK.<br><br>
        Energy consumption = 9.24 x 17,000 = 157,053 GJ<br><br>
        Energy consumption per shipping container = 157,053 ÷ 18,000 = 8.73 GJ<br><br>
        One shipping container has a volume of 38.5 m2 [7], and it is also assumed that the
        dimensions of a phone box are 0.1 x 0.1 x 0.2 m.<br><br>
        Phones per shipping container = 38.5 / (0.1 x 0.1 x 0.2) = 19,250 phones<br><br>
        Energy to transport one phone = 8.73 / 19,250 = 0.453 MJ<br><br>Therefore it can be seen that the calculated
        value for the energy in transport of 0.453 MJ, is
        significantly less than the value of 1.26 MJ calculated by CES EduPack, however in the same
        order of magnitude. This difference is likely due to inefficiencies such as the ship taking a
        longer route, or not being loaded to 100% capacity.
