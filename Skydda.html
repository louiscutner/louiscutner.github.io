        <h5 class="top">Skydda enables glasses-wearing students to work in labs and workshops without having to face the
            issues
            presented by wearing safety goggles over their glasses. Our solution uses magnets to attach protective “side
            rims” quickly and easily to their glasses.<br><br></h5>
        <h5 class="itallics">“It’s lightweight, comfortable and easy to use, much less of a
            hassle than oversized lab goggles.”</h5>
        <h3 class="project_subheading_top">Concept</h3>
        <h5>Our kit consists of two custom 3D-printed side rims, three pairs of differently sized magnets, and foam
            strips
            of two different thicknesses. The side rims are designed parametrically from data submitted by the user to
            ensure an optimal fit to the user’s glasses. The foam strips can be used to fill in any small gaps between
            the
            glasses and the side rims for added safety. These kits are sent to users, along with a simple step-by-step
            guide
            to set up the side rims for use with their usual prescription glasses. The side rims can then be quickly
            secured
            in place on the glasses magnetically, whenever they are required for work in laboratories and workshops. The
            side rims are lightweight, stylish and comfortable, and can easily be transported in a case, attached to the
            user’s glasses case.

        <h3 class="project_subheading">Promotional Video</h3>
        <h5>To succesfully market our product, and explain how it works to the general public we made a promotional
            video.
        </h5>

        <h3 class="project_subheading">Initial User Research</h3>
        <h5>Initially, to explore the user group of students in labs, we conducted a survey of 30 people, and numerous
            in depth interviews were carried out. This was done
            to inform us of the problems faced by students, as well as giving us general information about the
            demographic such that we would be able to ideate.
        </h5>
        <img class="project" src="images/Skydda/image_2.png">
        <h3 class="project_subheading">Personas</h3>
        <h5>With all of the information about our demographic, two personas were made. It was clear there was a split
            amongst the users. The two groups identified were students in labs (as seen on the left), and professionals
            (as seen on the right). The personas allowed us to collate all the research we had conducted and create a
            product with a specific requirement.
        </h5>
        <img class="project" src="images/Skydda/image_3.png">
        <h3 class="project_subheading">User Journeys</h3>
        <h5>User journeys were created for each of the user groups in order to identify problems, thoughts and emotions
            at each stage of an ordinary day using lab goggles.
        </h5>
        <img class="project" src="images/Skydda/image_4.png">
        <h3 class="project_subheading">User Scenario</h3>
        <h5>Two user scenarios were created to explore spefic problems experienced with the existing solutions.
        </h5>
        <img class="project" src="images/Skydda/image_5.png">
        <h3 class="project_subheading">Team Roles</h3>
        <h5>As this was a group project, the infographic below was created to clearly show how each memeber contributed
            to the team.
        </h5>
        <img class="project" src="images/Skydda/image_6.png">
        <h3 class="project_subheading">Secondary User Research</h3>
        <h5>At this stage, further research was conducted with users as we now felt we had found specific problems that
            we wanted to address, so feedback on this from users along with targeted questions proved very useful.
        </h5>
        <img class="project" src="images/Skydda/image_7.png">
        <h3 class="project_subheading">Ideation</h3>
        <h5>With all our research having been performed, low fidelity prototypes were created as a proof of concept to
            test whether ideas were worth pursuing.
        </h5>
        <img class="project" src="images/Skydda/image_8.png">
        <h3 class="project_subheading">Prototyping</h3>
        <h5>Further in depth prototyping involving 3D printing and user testing was carried out in order to get feedback
            along each stage as the idea was developed.
        </h5>
        <img class="project" src="images/Skydda/image_9.png">
        <h3 class="project_subheading">Case Design</h3>
        <h5>A lot of feedback from users suggested a case would complement the product, and so a case was designed for
            the side rims.
        </h5>
        <img class="project" src="images/Skydda/image_10.png">
        <h3 class="project_subheading">Branding</h3>
        <h5>To market the product, intensive research was performed on similar brands to look at how we should brand our
            own products.
        </h5>
        <img class="project" src="images/Skydda/image_11.png">
        <h3 class="project_subheading">Logo Design</h3>
        <h5>Based on the branding benchmarking performed, a logo was designed, with each element being thoroughly
            considered to coincide with the brand ideology.
