            <h3 class="project_title">WHICH SOCIO-ECONOMIC FACTORS CAN PREDICT THE
                SUICIDE RATE IN A UK LOCAL AUTHORITY?</h3>
        </div>
    </div>
    <h5 class="top">Overall, 5691 suicides were registered in England and Wales in 2019, the highest since 2000. The
        suicide rate of young people aged
        10 to 24 had increased by 94% since 2012 [1]. To help remedy this, it is important to understand which
        socio-economic
        demographics directly impact the number of suicides.<br><br>
        Various demographic data were collected from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) [2], for different local
        authorities of the UK,
        in 2016. Examples of some of the data collected were the number of drug deaths, total fertility rate, old age
        dependency ratio,
        distance travelled to work, house price pear area, GDP per capita, etc. In total there were 28 different
        predictors to investigate.
        These data were collected for each of the UK’s local authorities, giving 302 data points for each category. Data
        for each local
        authority’s suicide rate were collected for the year of 2016 (total deaths in that year). A full list of the
        attributes used can be found in
        appendix 5.1.<br><br>
        The report is split into two parts, an explanatory analysis, and a predictive analysis. The explanatory analysis
        looks at which factors
        have a statistically significant impact on suicide rates. The second part of the report attempts to create a
        predictive model to predict
        the suicide rate of a local authority, based on the other socio-economic data. The model is tested on a test
        data set containing a
        randomly selected subset of the data from 2016.</h5>
    <h3 class="project_subheading">PREPARING THE DATA</h3>
    <h5>Firstly, all the data for 2016 had to be compiled together into one large data set.
        Data from some local authorities had to be removed as there were some
        missing data points and null values. Once this was done, a box and whisker
        plot was created for the suicide rates and outliers were identified that were
        outside the range Q<sub>3</sub> + 1.5 x IQR and Q<sub>1</sub> - 1.5 x IQR. These outliers were then
        removed from the data (code in appendix 5.3.1).
    </h5>
    <img class="project" src="images/Data/image_1.png">
    <h3 class="project_subheading">EXPLANATORY ANALYSIS</h3>
    <h5>In the explanatory analysis, we are looking to find what differences in local authorities’ demographics
        correlate to differing suicide
        rates. Linear regression (ordinary least squares regression, or OLS) models are used, with the suicide rate as
        the continuous
        dependent variable.<br><br>Based on our own intuition and anecdotal evidence, we hypothesised that there would
        be a correlation between the number of drug
        deaths, and number of suicides. We also predicted that there would be a connection between the total female
        population and suicide
        rate, since suicide is over three times more common amongst men [1].<br><br>28 OLS models were produced, and the
        six that showed the strongest correlation between the predictors and suicide rates are
        shown below, as well as the RSS and R2 values. The closer the R2 value is to 1, the stronger the correlation is.
        The highest R2 value
        was from female population, with an R2 value of 0.585 (code in appendix 5.3.3).
    </h5>
    <img class="project" src="images/Data/image_2.png">
    <h3 class="project_subheading">PREDICTIVE ANALYSIS - EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS AND PREPARING THE DATA</h3>
    <h5>To help reduce the number of suicides, local authorities should investigate what demographic factors are likely
        to increase their
        suicide rate. It would be useful for the government to have a model to predict what areas will have the highest
        suicide rate based on
        their socio-economic data, to aid local authorities in making changes to reduce the number of suicides and
        getting help to those
        who need it.<br><br>Firstly, the data was split into three different sections. The first section is a training
        data set made up from 60% of the original
        dataset. This will be used to build and refine the predictive model. The second section is the validation set,
        made up from 20% of the
        original data set. While training the data set, the validation set is used to check the accuracy of the model,
        to ensure that the model
        is not over-fitting. Finally, there is the testing data set, also made up from 20% of the original data set.
        This is only used once the
        model is finished, to test that it is accurate in making predictions on an unknown data set (code in appendix
        5.3.2).<br><br>The suicide rate data were split into three classes: 0 to 10, 11 to 21 and 22 to 33 suicides. The
        aim of the model is to be able to
        predict within which class a national authority will fall into. Figure 8 shows these three classes, and the
        frequency of each class.
        It is clear from Figure 8 that the data set is imbalanced, and there are much fewer occurrences of class 3 (22
        to 33 suicides). To
        remedy this, oversampling is used to balance the data set (code in appendix 5.3.4).<br><br>The balanced data set
        can be seen in figure 9. There is an approximately equal number of occurrences in each group, and there are
        three groups, so for the model to be effective, it will need to beat an accuracy of 33% (which can be obtained
        by randomly selecting
        a class for a local authority).
    </h5>
    <img class="project" src="images/Data/image_3.png">
    <h3 class="project_subheading">PREDICTIVE ANALYSIS - CREATING THE MODEL</h3>
    <h5>The model would need to take in continuous data to make a multiclass prediction, so a decision tree will be
        used. The following
        method was used to select the hyper parameters for the decision tree:<br><br>
        1. First the model was trained using the training data set<br>
        2. Different values for the parameters of minimum gini impurity decrease and depth were tested on for the model
        to see which gave
        the most accurate results on both the training and validation data sets (i.e. best of both)
        (code in appendix 5.3.4)<br><br>We first picked the depth as 4, as this is when the accuracy of the validation
        set predictions peaks, at a value of approximately 0.65.
        It is also when the training predictions and validation predictions are closest to one another before the
        evaluation accuracy starts to
        decrease again (see Figure 11).<br><br>Once we chose the depth, we looked at Figure 10 and found that the
        optimum impurity decrease for a depth of 4 was between
        0.001 and 0.004, so we picked 0.0025.
    </h5>
    <img class="project" src="images/Data/image_4.png">
    <h3 class="project_subheading">PREDICTIVE ANALYSIS - ANALYSIS OF MODEL</h3>
    <h5>The results show that the model is effective for making predictions in the training data set with an accuracy of
        80.3%, and in the
        validation data set to an accuracy of 65.5%, which is considerably higher than the minimum accuracy required
        (which was 33.3%
        which could be achieved by guessing at random).<br><br>The first split is based on female population, if it is
        above a certain threshold number. The model continues to split based on all six
        of the key features that we hypothesised to be relevant in 2.2. It is worth noting that five of the fifteen
        splits were based on female
        population, which makes sense, because in part 2.2 it was found that this attribute had the strongest
        correlation with suicide rates
        of all the predictors we looked at.<br><br>The results have ginis in the range from 0 to 0.52. The gini with the
        best value (of zero) was in areas where the female population is
        less than 61450, and more than 6093 people walk to work. These indicators would suggest that the area would be
        class 1
        (between 0 and 10 suicides). Another example of a low gini would be in areas where female population is greater
        than 146000,
        there are less than 16.5 drug related deaths, but more than 10.5 drug misuse related deaths. This would have
        predicted class 2
        (between 11 and 21 suicides) with a gini of 0 as well.<br><br>When the final model was applied to the test data
        set, an accuracy of 58.6% was achieved, which is not too high, although still much
        higher than the probability of randomly guessing the suicide rate correctly (33%).

    <h3 class="project_subheading">Conclusion</h3>
    <h5>This model highlights how difficult it is to accurately predict a person’s likelihood of committing suicide
        purely based on
        demographics of the area in which they live. There are far more factors that would need to be considered, some
        completely
        independent of the socio-economic environment.<br><br>The main predictor used was the female population, though
        it is known that males are significantly (over three times) more likely to
        commit suicide than women, so just by looking at how many men there are, it would be easy to assume that there
        would be a higher
        suicide rate. This is not particularly insightful or useful, because it is not something that can be changed or
        used to reduce people’s
        likelihood of committing suicide.<br><br>Furthermore, the model’s accuracy (though better than random chance),
        is still quite low, and a lot more data and training would be
        needed to make accurate predictions about suicide rates. For example, we were unable to find good data on
        education in the UK’s
        local authorities, which would likely have been a huge influencing factor, especially considering that a large
        majority of suicides are
        in young people aged between 10 and 24.
