            <h3 class="project_title">Improving energy efficiency of a flat</h3>
        </div>
    </div>
    <h5 class="top">I wanted to investigate my current flat, to look into how eco-friendly it was, and what proposals I
        could make to bring the flat’s energy consumption
        closer to net zero. The flat consists of three bedrooms, one bathroom, one kitchen, one living room and a hall
        way. The flat is situated within a
        relatively old mansion block and so has no new technological interventions intended to save energy; it has
        single glazed windows for example.<br><br>
        Firstly I looked at the mains cold water supply, and suggested an intervention of doubling the pipe diameter
        from ½ inch to 1 inch. This was
        calculated to reduce pressure loss in the pipe due to friction by 50%, hence saving energy. I looked in detail
        at the cold water supply from the
        mains to the faucet in the kitchen as an example, however the proposed intervention could be applied to all
        water pipes throughout the flat.<br><br>
        Secondly, I looked at replacing the single glazed windows in the flat to triple glazed windows – with each pane
        of glass separated by 6.4 mm of
        air. It was calculated that by implementing triple glazed windows, the heat loss due to convection in the flat
        through the windows was reduced by
        75.7%.<br><br>
        The third intervention was to create a composite wall with 0.25 m of glass wool insulation in between two layers
        of brick – instead of currently
        only a single layer brick wall. By implementing this intervention the heat lost by conduction through the walls
        is reduced by 94.6%.<br><br>
        The final intervention was to replace the 16 Halogen light bulbs with Compact Fluorescent (CFL) light bulbs. By
        implementing this intervention,
        the energy consumption in a year with typical usage of 8 hours a day per lightbulb is reduced by 67%.
        <h3 class="project_subheading">FLAT FLOORPLAN AND ROOMS</h3>
        <h5>Below is the floorplan of the flat, containing dimensions of each wall, and a breakdown of the
            components in each room relating to pipe flow and electricity.
        </h5>

        <h3 class="project_subheading">INTERVENTION 1</h3>
        <h5>The first intervention to my flat is
            regarding the mains water supply. I will
            look specifically at the pipe supplying
            cold water to the faucet in the kitchen,
            to show the energy saving effects of
            doubling the pipe diameter from 1/2
            inch to 1 inch. This reduces pressure
            loss in the pipe due to friction, hence
            saving energy. To the right I have drawn
            the path of the pipe from the mains
            supply in the street to the faucet.
            <br><br>
            <b>Assumptions:</b>
            <br>
            • The pipes currently used are 1/2 inch
            CPVC pipes¹ with an internal diameter
            of 0.528 inches ² = 13.4 mm
            <br>• The volume flow rate of cold water is
            approximately 2 gallons per min ¹
            = 1.39 x 10-4 m³/s
            <br>• The same pipe is used from the mains
            to the faucet
            <br>• The temperature of the water inside the
            pipe is approximately 12.5 degrees
            Celcius³, and so the water’s dynamic
            viscosity = 1.22 x 10-3 Pa . s
            <br>• The pressure of the water from the
            mains supply is 3 bar<sup>4</sup>

        <h3 class="project_subheading">INTERVENTION 2</h3>
        <h5>The second intervention to my flat is
            regarding the windows. As the flat is
            relatively old, all of the windows are
            single glazed. I will look at the effect of
            replacing all of the windows in the flat
            with tripple glazed windows with an air
            gap of 6.4 mm between each pane of
            glass. This insulation means the energy
            lost due to convection through the
            windows is dramatically decreased.
            <br><br>
            <b>Assumptions:</b>
            <br>
            • The total length of windows was
            measured to be 18.53 m
            <br>• The windows remain tightly sealed the
            entire time, and there are no leaks

        <h3 class="project_subheading">INTERVENTION 3</h3>
        <h5>The third intervention to my flat is
            regarding the insulation of the walls.
            Currently, due to the age of the building,
            all of the walls are single thickness brick
            with no insulation. I will look at the
            energy savings from constructing two
            brick walls, with a 25 cm layer of glass
            wool insulation in the middle. The
            insulation dramatically reduces the
            energy losses due to conduction though
            the walls.
            <br><br>
            <b>Assumptions:</b>
            <br>
            • Space for the additional walls could be
            accomodated for
            <br>• There is no energy loss to the flats
            above and below, or the the hallway
            outside the flat
            <br>• Insulation is 230 mm thick<sup>6</sup>

        <h3 class="project_subheading">INTERVENTION 4</h3>
        <h5>The fourth intervention to my flat is
            regarding the light bulbs. I will look at
            replacing the Halogen light bulbs with
            Compact Fluorescent (CFL) light bulbs.
            This would significantly reduce the
            energy consumption in each room as
            the CFL light bulbs are much more
            energy efficient than the Halogen light
            bulbs.
            <br><br>
            <b>Assumptions:</b>
            <br>
            • All the light bulbs in the flat are the
            same
            <br>• There are 16 lightbulbs in the flat
            <br>• The light bulbs have an output of 800
            lumens
