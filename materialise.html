        </div>
    </div>
    <h5 class="top">In this report, a range of 69 materials is explored to find the ideal material for Tomaszewska
        Eco-Innovations to make a plane
        wing out of. Tomaszewska Eco-Innovations is an eco-friendly design company, and so the criteria considered when
        deciding
        what material the wing should be made from were eco-friendliness, strength, durability, cost, and a semantic
        survey was
        conducted.<br><br>
        First, the 69 materials were narrowed down to seven, on which further exploration was conducted. These seven
        materials were
        selected as they had appropriate Young’s moduli and densities. The eco-friendly and mechanical properties of
        these seven
        materials were compared and as a result, aluminium was chosen as the material that Tomaszewska Eco-Innovations
        should
        use for their plane wing.</h5>
    <h3 class="project_subheading">BOUNDARY CONDITIONS</h3>
    <h5>The wing of a plane is a key structural element, and so although Tomaszewska Eco-Innovations had asked for an
        eco-friendly
        material to make the plane wing out of, the wing also had to be structurally strong enough to support the plane
        as to not lead
        to failure. Hence certain materials were disregarded purely for safety and to maintain structural integrity.
        Furthermore, it was
        important to compare material longevity to eco-friendliness, as a material which has a small carbon footprint
        but needs to be
        replaced frequently may result in more emissions than a material with a slightly greater carbon footprint but
        much better
        longevity.<br><br>
        To make an efficient plane, the weight must be kept to a minimum, hence although certain materials may be
        fantastically
        strong, if their density is too large, in practice they would be useless. For this reason, only those materials
        with a density of less
        than 5000kg/m3 were considered.<br><br>
        In order to select light materials that were also strong enough, a performance index was calculated for the wing
        of a plane
        using the assumption that it has the shape of a rectangular prism. The performance index prioritises a large
        Young’s modulus
        and low density to achieve this. When plotting the log of Young’s modulus on the Y - axis, against the log of
        density on the X -
        axis, the gradient is the performance index which was determined to be a gradient of one.<br><br>
        With the performance index, along with the limit of density being less than 5000kg/m3 the range of materials was
        refined to
        a suitable selection to then further explore.
    </h5>
    <h3 class="project_subheading">MATERIAL EXPLORATION</h3>
    <h5>Using CES EduPack, the 69 materials in level one were limited by the performance index (keeping only those above
        a line
        with a gradient of one) and by selecting only those with a density of less than 5000kg/m3 (mentioned in boundary
        conditions). Technical ceramics, glasses and non-technical ceramics were also removed as although they all
        appear suitable
        from the graph, in reality, they are far too brittle to be practical for a plane wing. All the materials
        excluded are grey in Figure 1,
        and all the families are labelled.<br><br>
        As a result of these limitations, the 69 materials in level one were narrowed down to seven materials which were
        further
        explored and narrowed down based on eco-friendliness, tensile strength, fatigue strength, and price. These
        materials were all
        in the material families composites, metals and alloys, or natural materials. The seven remaining materials
        produced by CES
        EduPack (shown in Figure 2) were:<br><br>
        1. Aluminium alloys<br>
        2. Bamboo<br>
        3. CFRP, epoxy matrix (Carbon fibre)<br>
        4. GFRP, epoxy matrix (Fibreglass)<br>
        5. Magnesium alloys<br>
        6. Titanium alloys<br>
        7. Wood, typical along grain

    <h3 class="project_subheading">ECO-FRIENDLINESS</h3>
    <h5>To determine how eco-friendly each material was, first the materials were split into those which are recyclable
        and those which
        are not (see Table 1). All of the metals are recyclable but the natural materials and composites are not.
        Although the natural
        materials are not recyclable, they are sustainable as they are not finite resources and are not very resource
        intensive to
        produce. At this stage non recyclable materials will not be ruled out, but recyclable materials will be favoured
        going forward as
        they tend to be more eco-friendly.<br><br>
        CO2 footprint was plotted against the embodied energy in each material (see Figure 3). Figure 3 shows that
        natural materials
        (bamboo and wood) performed much better than the composites and metals. However it is also apparent that
        magnesium
        alloys, titanium alloys and carbon fibre performed particularly poorly. Table 2 shows the three materials which
        had the lowest
        embodied energies. Although fibre glass performed in the top three in Table 2, its average embodied energy is
        nearly four
        times that of bamboo (which was second best). This is very similar to how the seven materials’ CO2 footprints
        compared in
        Table 3. In fact, the difference between glass fibre and bamboo’s CO2 footprints are more extreme than the
        difference between
        their embodied energies as fibre glass has a CO2 footprint of over six times bamboo’s.<br><br>
        Materials that will potentially be disregarded as contenders for the plane wing, having considered their
        eco-friendly
        properties, are magnesium alloys, titanium alloys, and carbon fibre. Whereas those that will be looked at
        favourably for their
        eco-friendly properties are wood and bamboo.
    </h5>
    <img class="project" src="images/Materialise/image_2.png">
    <h3 class="project_subheading">TENSILE STRENGTH</h3>
    <h5>To determine how strong each material was, embodied energy was plotted against tensile strength (figure 4),
        hence
        comparing eco-friendliness to strength. A general trend is seen that as the material has a greater tensile
        strength, it has a
        greater embodied energy. However there are some interesting outliers as although wood has fantastic eco-friendly
        properties,
        its tensile strength is far below any others - hence it will likely have to be disregarded. Conversely titanium
        alloys and carbon
        fibre have excellent tensile strengths (highest and second highest respectively) but their excessive embodied
        energies will
        likely result in them being excluded as well. This is because their tensile strengths are superfluously large,
        and tensile
        strength is not so important that it is worth disregarding the eco-friendliness of the material entirely. The
        resulting materials
        cluster around a moderate tensile strength whist their embodied energies differ vastly. When looking at these
        materials
        bamboo stands out as it has the lowest embodied energy of this middle group whilst still a respectable tensile
        strength.
        However, at 348 MPa (see Table 4) aluminium has a tensile strength (still less than half titanium’s) much larger
        than bamboo
        with a tensile strength of 239.5 MPa. So it also very respectable and has an adequate embodied energy.
    </h5>
    <img class="project" src="images/Materialise/image_3.png">
    <h3 class="project_subheading">FATIGUE STRENGTH</h3>
    <h5>To determine how durable each material was, in terms of its longevity as a plane wing, the fatigue strength of
        each material
        was explored. The comparative fatigue strength of each material after 107 cycles showed which of the materials
        would have a
        longer operating life as a plane wing. It is also important to consider the price of the material. If a material
        was to have a low
        fatigue strength, so not last very long as a plane wing, but also be very cheap, it could be more effective than
        a material with a
        high fatigue strength but absurdly high price. Hence although it may seem logical to seek a material with very
        high fatigue
        strength and very low price, this material may not be best for Tomaszewska Eco-Innovations.<br><br>
        When looking at Figure 5, it is apparent that fibreglass, carbon fibre and titanium alloys have fantastic
        fatigue strengths as
        they are each in the top three, with titanium alloys having a fatigue strength of 492 MPa (refer to Table 6).
        However, they are
        all likely far too expensive to be appropriate as they would make the wing unaffordable. The remaining materials
        are all
        significantly cheaper with magnesium and aluminium alloys performing particularly well as they are both cheap
        and have
        relatively high fatigue strengths. As an example aluminium performs excellently as it is the third cheapest
        material at 1.965
        GBP/kg (refer to Table 5), not much more than wood or bamboo, and still has the third highest fatigue strength.

    <h3 class="project_subheading">SEMANTIC DIFFERENTIAL SCALES</h3>
    <h5>In order to explore the public’s perception of the seven materials, 13 random members of the public filled in a
        survey for each
        material. Answers were given as a number from 0 to 10, with 0 being completely disagree, and 10 being completely
        agree.
        For each material, five questions were asked:<br><br>
        • Like - how much do you like the material (10 being a lot)? This was asked to determine the public’s perception
        of the
        material. If a material is very highly performing but universally disliked it would be unwise to choose this
        material as
        customers wouldn’t buy it.<br>
        • Eco-friendliness - how eco-friendly do you think the material is? This was asked as the aim for Tomaszewska
        Eco-
        Innovations is to create an eco-friendly plane wing. If the customer doesn’t see the material as an inherently
        ecofriendly
        material then they won’t believe it is very eco-friendly.<br>
        • Strength - how strong do you think the material is? This was asked as passengers on a plane would not feel
        safe
        boarding a plane if the wing was made of a material perceived to be weak.<br>
        • Durability - how durable do you think the material is? This was asked as if the customer doesn’t believe the
        material is
        durable that won’t trust that it will have a long working life span and so choose another plane wing.<br>
        • Price - how expensive do you think the material is (10 being very cheap)? This was asked as if the material is
        expensive,
        the customer would not want for the public to believe it is an inherently cheap material - they want the
        passengers to
        be perceive the plane wing as very high end and expensive.

    <h3 class="project_subheading">Conclusion</h3>
    <h5>The aim of this investigation was to choose a material that Tomaszewska Eco-Innovations could use to create
        eco-friendly plane
        wings. Firstly, CED EduPack was used to narrow down 69 materials to 7 which were then explored in greater depth.
        As it is the
        largest factor, the eco-friendliness of each material was looked at first - recyclability, embodied energy, and
        CO2 emissions in
        production. From this research it was determined that even though they have fantastic strength properties,
        magnesium alloys,
        titanium alloys, and carbon fibre would have to be disregarded. This was due to their high emissions and
        embodied energies
        in primary production. Furthermore carbon fibre isn’t recyclable.<br><br>
        Then the remaining materials were assessed on their strength by comparing their tensile strengths and their
        fatigue
        strengths. From this research it was determined that wood would have to be disregarded as its tensile strength
        was
        significantly below that of the others. Price was also looked at, and fibreglass was disregarded as it offered
        no greater fatigue
        strength or tensile strength than aluminium and yet was significantly more expensive.<br><br>
        With only aluminium alloys and bamboo left, a semantic survey was done to gauge the public’s perception on the
        materials.
        From this data, it was observed that aluminium is preferred and perceived as stronger and more durable than
        bamboo
        although slightly less eco-friendly.<br><br>
        Aluminium was chosen as the material for Tomaszewska Eco-Innovations to use for their plane wing as although
        bamboo
        outperforms it in embodied energy and CO2 emissions, aluminium is recyclable where bamboo is not. Furthermore in
        tensile
        strength and fatigue strength, aluminium performs much better than bamboo, whilst only having a slightly greater
        price.
        Therefore as it would have a much longer working life than bamboo it would be cheaper in the long term.
        Furthermore the
        public’s perception of aluminium is that it is stronger and more durable than bamboo so would feel safer to
        passengers flying
        in a plane with aluminium wings.
